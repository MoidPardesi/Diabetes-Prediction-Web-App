**Diabetes Risk Prediction - Master's Dissertation**

**Overview**
This repository contains the machine learning models and visualization scripts used in my Masterâ€™s dissertation at Sheffield Hallam University, focusing on the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset.

**Project Description**
The project involved cleaning and visualizing extensive health data to understand factors influencing diabetes. Various plots were used to explore demographics, health behaviors, and medical indicators. Advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), were applied to predict diabetes risk with an 88% accuracy.

**Key Features**
Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicates and correction of inconsistencies.
Visualization: Utilization of bar charts, heatmaps, box plots, and density plots.
Machine Learning: Implementation of Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Models, and MLPs.
Web Application: Development of a Streamlit app to assess personal diabetes risk, available here.

**Impact**
This work demonstrates the use of machine learning to interpret health data and provides a foundation for further research in data science and healthcare. The web application serves as a practical tool for public health awareness and decision-making
